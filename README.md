- 👋 Hi, I’m @crdev.ar

I´M a passionate about technology and music since I was a child. The computers have been a part of my whole life, I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know how they worked, why they worked and what else they could do.

Currently I am dedicated to development sites and web applications , creating esthetical and functional solutions for my customers. When I'm not working I dedicate time for music production, where I can unite my passions.
